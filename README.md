# Angular1 Material Design Data Table

This module is an effort to implement Material Design data tables in [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/#/). Data tables are used to present raw data sets and usually appear in desktop enterprise applications. Data tables are particularly useful for visualizing and manipulating large data sets.
